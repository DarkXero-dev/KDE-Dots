# This is my Layan Rice Dot-Files

### Disclaimer

I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. Rice uses custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of my hands.

### Performance :

This rice has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

Just git clone this repo and run the `./install.sh` script that's all. Optimized to work on any **Arch-Based** Distro with **KDE-Plasma**...

### Side-Note :

> If you apply this rice and something goes wrong, well, that's not a fault of my own, it's just KDE being what it is, to remedy the situation, you are kindly requested to re-apply the rice again, that should fix it. Sorry about that but sometimes KDE can be a pain.. I still love it though ;)

### Your Settings

Keep in mind that it will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup, so please do not report that. You have been warned. Best of luck !

- Create a backup of your ~/.config folder.
