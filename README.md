### This is the Layan Dot-Files I made for XeroLinux

<h3 align="center">This is just a small taste of what XeroLinux is.<br /> For the whole experience you must <a href="https://xerolinux.xyz">install the Distro</a> & use it.</h3>

### Disclaimer

I also would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. Rice uses custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of my hands.

### Performance :

This rice has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

Just copy & paste below command in terminal & run it that's it. Optimized to work on any **Arch-Based** Distro with **KDE-Plasma**...
```
git clone https://github.com/DarkXero-dev/KDE-Dots && cd KDE-Dots && ./install.sh
```

### Side-Note :

> If you apply this rice and something goes wrong, well, that's not a fault of my own, it's just KDE being what it is, to remedy the situation, you are kindly requested to re-apply the rice again, that should fix it. Sorry about that but sometimes KDE can be a pain.. I still love it though ;)

### Your Settings

Keep in mind that it will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup, so please do not report that. You have been warned. Best of luck !

## Script will do the following steps :

- Create a backup of your ~/.config folder.
- Download and install necessary packages if needed...
- Override your settings and files with this rice's.
